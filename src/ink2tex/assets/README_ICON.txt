# Icon Placeholder
# 
# For a professional build, replace this with a proper icon.ico file
# The icon should be 256x256 pixels for best results
# 
# You can create an icon from the app's logo or use online tools like:
# - https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
# - https://www.icoconverter.com/
#
# Place the icon.ico file in this assets/ folder and the build script
# will automatically include it in the executable and installer.
